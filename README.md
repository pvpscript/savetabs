# savetabs
A web browser extension that allows the user to save every tab's url to a file

# Disclaimer
This extension was made with the purpose of studying how browser add-ons work, thus the simple ideia. I also hope that this extension can help people out with their necessities as well as devs with how to code a browser extension.

# Introduction
[plaintext]: /images/plaintext.png "Plain text"
[plaintext-raw]: /images/plaintext_raw.png "Plain text raw"
[json-mini]: /images/json_minified.png "JSON minified"
[json-read]: /images/json_readable.png "JSON readable"

This browser's extension allows the user to save every tab's url to a file. This can be achieved in several ways:
* Save every tab for the current browser window;
* Save every tab for every browser window;

And it also has different output formats:
* Plain text, with or without an indicator for the window id at the top of each URL section;
![alt text][plaintext]
![alt text][plaintext-raw]
* JSON (contains URL and title), minified or readable;
![alt text][json-mini]
![alt text][json-read]
